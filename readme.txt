Better, use the Clearfy plugin, which is updates and supports by WordPress professionals and, in addition, does not load your site.

Thus, the Clearfy plugin, amazing with its functions, will be your indispensable assistant to improve:

* security;
* promotion and SEO;
* speed of the website, blog and online store.

> **Important notice!** Clearfy does not replace defense, promotion and acceleration plugins, it's only complements them.
