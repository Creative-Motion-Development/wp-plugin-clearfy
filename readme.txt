Disables unused Wordpress features, improves performance and increases SEO rankings, using Clearfy, which makes WordPress very easy.

== Description ==

Our company has been developing plugins and themes for Wordpress for many years and every time we develop a website for our clients, we face a number of problems. Our clients` websites are highly specialized and most of the functions that Wordpress provides are not required for the operation of their sites. These functions are simply not used by our clients, but still they consume hosting resources or create SEO optimization problems, sometimes they just disturb editors in their daily work. Fortunately for you, we made a decision to release a universal plugin to enable and disable unused Wordpress options.

Previously, ordinary webmasters had to hire a developer and pay a huge amount of money to solve typical tasks for disabling functions and optimizing Wordpress. Now most of your problems have been shifted to our shoulders and we are ready to solve them. All you need to do is to download the free plugin Cleary. We personally tested all functions of the plugin on our sites and achieved good results of WordPress performance. Testing was done on such popular resources as Pingdom, GTmetrix, PageSpeed and YSlow.

We also noticed a very important feature: improvement of pages indexing and increase of the website`s traffic, due to simple seo optimization.

We recently added very useful features <strong>WP Asset CleanUp Manager (Gonzales)</strong>, <strong>Disable Comments and remove comments in database</strong>, <strong>Heartbeat Control</strong>, <strong>Disable updates and enable automatic plugins and themes updates</strong>

Forget about opening functions.php and entering code yourself! It is not only inconvenient but also can lead to critical errors and break your site. This code is not updated and as a result becomes obsolete. Use Clearfy to solve the needed tasks, because the plugin does not load your site and is constantly updated by professionals in the Wordpress field.

Of course, there are many similar solutions to our plugin, but in order to replace the Clearfy plugin, you will need to install more than 30 plugins, where each plugin plays its small role.
This amazing plugin will be an excellent helper in SEO optimization, performance optimization and security.

Important to know! This plugin does not replace the functions of other plugins in the area of SEO optimization or performance optimization, security, etc. Our plugin complements these functions, so feel free to download free Clearfy and disable unused Wordpress functions.

Everyone must have this plugin. Tell your friends and colleagues about it, so you will help them to solve a lot of problems connected with Wordpress.
