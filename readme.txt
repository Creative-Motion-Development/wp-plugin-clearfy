Initially we used optimization plugin for customer’s projects and ours but later we understood that problem is global so we shared plugin for you absolutely free.

### More than 50 Clearfy plugin features for WordPress optimization ###

#### PAGE CACHING ####

Clearfy Cache is a simple, yet powerful WordPress caching plugin that is easy to use, needs minimal configuration, and best of all helps improve site performance for a faster load time. It creates static HTML files of frontend pages and stores them on the server’s disk. This allows the static HTML files to be delivered instead of generating pages on the fly, avoiding resource intensive backend processes from the WordPress core, plugins, and database.

HOW DOES THE CACHING WORK? Clearfy Cache captures page contents and saves it as a static HTML file on the server’s disk. The static HTML file created can be one of several possible cache versions depending on the plugin settings and HTTP request. Accepted static HTML files are then delivered without any database queries or on the fly compression, allowing for a quicker page load.

* Added: new component for image optimization. We’ve created a 100% free solution for image optimization, which is as good as the paid products. The plugin optimizes your images automatically, reducing their weight with no quality loss.
* Added: new component for scripts & styles optimization - this component combines all your scripts and styles in one file, compresses & caches it.
* Added: new component for HTML compression - we’ve completely redesigned HTML compression of the pages and added these features to another component. It’s more stable and reliable solution for HTML code optimization of your pages.
* Added: new [premium] component for Hide Wordpress - this premium component helps in hiding your WordPress from hackers and bots. Basically, it disables identification of your CMS by changing directories and files names, removing meta data and replacing HTML content which can provide all information about the platform you use. Most websites can be hacked easily, as hackers and bots know all security flaws in plugins, themes and the WordPress core. You can secure the website from the attack by hiding the information the hackers will need.

* Added: you can exclude sending the If-Modified-Since header for the main page, because main pages update really rare.
* Fixed: conflict with the Divi theme – some users were missing the settings panel when the “Hide Admin notification” component was used.
* Fixed: problem with displaying the Font Awesome icons with enabled asynchronous font loading.
* The “Hide login page” module turned into the separate component. It is no longer enabled by default. Attention! If you’ve ever used features associated with hiding login page, then, please, re-activate this component.
